//! Rendering time meter.
//!
//! Used to track rendering times and provide moving averages.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! ```rust
//! // create a meter
//! let mut meter = crate::terminal::meter::Meter::new();
//!
//! // Sample something.
//! {
//!     let _sampler = meter.sampler();
//! }
//!
//! // Get the moving average. The meter tracks a fixed number of samples, and
//! // the average won't mean much until it's filled up at least once.
//! println!("Average time: {}", meter.average());
//! ```
